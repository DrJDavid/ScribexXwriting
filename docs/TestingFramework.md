# ScribexX Testing Framework

This document outlines the testing approach for the ScribexX application, covering unit, integration, and user testing strategies with a focus on educational and gamification elements.

## Testing Objectives

The ScribexX testing framework aims to:

1. Ensure the application functions correctly across supported devices and platforms
2. Verify the educational content provides appropriate learning experiences
3. Validate that gamification elements enhance rather than distract from learning
4. Confirm the application performs efficiently even on lower-end devices
5. Ensure accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities
6. Test offline functionality and data synchronization

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on individual components and functions in isolation.

#### Core Components to Test

| Component Type | Testing Focus | Testing Tools |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| UI Components | Props handling, rendering, user interactions | Jest, React Native Testing Library |
| Business Logic | State transformations, algorithms, data processing | Jest |
| Hooks | State management, lifecycle behavior | React Hooks Testing Library |
| Context Providers | State sharing, context updates | React Testing Library |
| Utility Functions | Data formatting, calculations | Jest |

#### Example Unit Tests

```javascript
// Testing a REDI map node component
import React from 'react';
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import REDIMapNode from '../components/redi/REDIMapNode';

describe('REDIMapNode Component', () => {
  const mockProps = {
    id: 'node-1',
    title: 'Grammar Basics',
    status: 'available',
    skillType: 'mechanics',
    position: { x: 100, y: 100 },
    onPress: jest.fn(),
  };

  it('renders correctly with available status', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<REDIMapNode {...mockProps} />);
    expect(getByText('Grammar Basics')).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it('calls onPress when pressed', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<REDIMapNode {...mockProps} />);
    fireEvent.press(getByText('Grammar Basics'));
    expect(mockProps.onPress).toHaveBeenCalledWith('node-1');
  });

  it('does not call onPress when locked', () => {
    const lockedProps = { ...mockProps, status: 'locked' };
    const { getByTestId } = render(<REDIMapNode {...lockedProps} />);
    fireEvent.press(getByTestId('node-container'));
    expect(mockProps.onPress).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  });

  it('displays mastery percentage when completed', () => {
    const completedProps = { 
      ...mockProps, 
      status: 'completed',
      mastery: 95
    };
    const { getByText } = render(<REDIMapNode {...completedProps} />);
    expect(getByText('95%')).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

```javascript
// Testing an exercise validation utility function
import { validateExerciseAnswer } from '../utils/exerciseUtils';

describe('Exercise Validation Utility', () => {
  it('validates multiple choice answers correctly', () => {
    const exercise = {
      id: 'ex-1',
      type: 'multipleChoice',
      answers: { correctOption: 2 },
    };
    
    expect(validateExerciseAnswer(exercise, 2)).toBe(true);
    expect(validateExerciseAnswer(exercise, 1)).toBe(false);
  });
  
  it('validates text editing answers correctly', () => {
    const exercise = {
      id: 'ex-2',
      type: 'textEditing',
      answers: { 
        errors: [
          { startIndex: 5, endIndex: 10, correctText: 'their' }
        ]
      },
    };
    
    const correctAnswer = [{ startIndex: 5, endIndex: 10, userText: 'their' }];
    const incorrectAnswer = [{ startIndex: 5, endIndex: 10, userText: 'there' }];

    // Continue to next screen
    fireEvent.press(getByText('Continue'));
    
    // Verify progress was updated
    expect(mockUpdateProgress).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      completedExercises: expect.arrayContaining(['ex-grammar-1']),
      skillMastery: expect.objectContaining({
        mechanics: expect.any(Number),

# ScribexX Style Guide

This style guide outlines the visual design language for the two distinct environments within ScribexX: the REDI (Reflective Exercise on Direct Instruction) section with its Synthwave/Cyberpunk aesthetic and the OWL (Open World Learning) section with its Botanical Futurism aesthetic.

- Header gradient: `linear-gradient(90deg, #3cb371 0%, #588157 100%)`

### Typography

- **Headings:** "Azonix" or "Cardo" - Organic yet futuristic
- **Body:** "Montserrat" or "Open Sans" - Clean, natural feel
- **Accents:** "Quicksand" - Rounded, organic feel for special elements

**Text Guidelines:**
- Headings: 24-28px, semi-bold, sentence case
- Subheadings: 18-20px, medium weight
- Body text: 16px, regular weight
- Small text: 14px, light weight
- Main text color: `#ffffff`
- Secondary text color: `#cccccc`

### UI Elements

**Buttons:**
- Primary buttons: Forest green background, white text, subtle plant-inspired borders
- Secondary buttons: Transparent with gold or teal accents
- Hover/active states with subtle growth/bloom effects
- Rounded corners (12-16px radius)

**Cards/Panels:**
- Rich green backgrounds (`#2d4438`)
- Organic, subtle borders or edge treatments
- Soft shadows
- Well-rounded corners (16px radius)

**Town Map Elements:**

- Vegetation: Digital interpretations of plants and trees
- Water elements: Flowing, animated where possible

**Icons:**

- **Transitions:** Organic, growth-based transitions between screens
- **Hover Effects:** Elements "bloom" or expand slightly on hover
- **Progress Indicators:** Vine-like or growing plant progress indicators

### OWL Layout Guidelines

- **Flowing Layout:** Less rigid than REDI, more organic placement
- **Natural Curves:** Use curved elements rather than strict angles
- **Asymmetry:** Balanced asymmetry rather than perfect alignment
- **Breathing Room:** Generous spacing between elements
- **Natural Hierarchy:** Create visual hierarchy through organic positioning

## 3. Shared UI Components

### Loading States

- **REDI Loading:** Digital scanning animation, loading bar
- **OWL Loading:** Growing plant or unfurling leaf animation

### Notifications

- **REDI Notifications:** Digital pop-up with electric glow
- **OWL Notifications:** Unfurling scroll or leaf with message

### Navigation

- **Bottom Tab Bar:** Consistent across environments but themed appropriately
- **REDI Icons:** Tech-inspired, angular
- **OWL Icons:** Nature-inspired, organic
- **Transitions:** Smooth theme transition when switching between environments

### Writing Interface

Keep the writing interface clean and distraction-free in both environments, but with subtle themed elements:

- **REDI Writing:** Digital paper, cyberpunk frame elements
- **OWL Writing:** Natural parchment texture, botanical frame elements
- **Focus Mode:** Ability to minimize all UI elements while writing

## 4. Asset Requirements

### REDI Assets

- Grid backgrounds
- Digital interface elements
- Neon button templates
- Level node designs (locked, available, completed)
- Cyberpunk frame elements
- Tech-inspired icons

### OWL Assets

- Botanical patterns
- Tree and plant illustrations
- Town map buildings
- NPC character portraits
- Organic UI frames
- Nature-inspired icons

## 5. Accessibility Considerations

- Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text elements
- Ensure interactive elements have distinct focus states
- Provide sufficient color contrast between interactive and non-interactive elements
- Use patterns in addition to color to distinguish states
- Ensure text sizes are adjustable
- Test interfaces with color blindness simulators

## 6. Implementation Notes

- Use Expo LinearGradient for gradient effects
- Consider React Native Reanimated for smooth animations
- Use consistent shadow implementations
- Create reusable styled components for each theme
- Implement theme switching through context
- Use vector assets where possible for scaling
- Consider adding subtle sound effects for interactions

This style guide provides the foundation for creating a cohesive yet distinct visual experience across the two learning environments while maintaining usability and accessibility.
